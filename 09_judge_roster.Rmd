```{r load-data, message=FALSE}

```

```{r message=FALSE}
n_judges <- nrow(judges)

```

As of `r today` we have `r n_judges` judges:

```{r}
judges %>%
  select(first_name, last_name, affiliation, title, email) %>%
  arrange(last_name) %>%
    datatable(options = list(
    pageLength = 30,
    lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 20)
    ))
```
